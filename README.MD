### Artwork branch for WIMM - Web Interface Media Manager for Kodi

WIMM is a cross platform tool to manage the Kodi Media Databases. It is completely web based, so you don't need to install anything on your workstation to manage your media.

This tool is intended to facilitate the use of the Kodi media management features (media info, media categorization, scraping, etc.)
