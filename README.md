WiMM - Web Interface Media Manager
====

WiMM is a cross platform tool to manage the Kodi Media Databases. It is completely web based, so you don't need to install anything on your workstation to manage your media.

This tool is intended to facilitate the use of the Kodi media management features (media infos, media categorization, scraping, etc ...)

### Submitting patches and PRs
The idea is to fork this repo work on your changes and make a pull request (PR) to the **master** branch, it should contain some of the following:

* What the patch addresses, if its a bug-fix a feature or improvement or something else.
* Any comments in code for what is not immediately obvious.

#### Note:
A pull request (PR) should be made to **master**, (using branches is ok if your going to make the same PR to master) by using master then your working with latest code and fixes. Any work can then be easily picked and pulled into branches if needed, especially if its a bug-fix.

#### What will happen to patches & PRs
* Subject to review and is merged as soon as possible by a member of the project.
